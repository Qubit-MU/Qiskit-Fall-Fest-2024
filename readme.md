### Hackathon Launch

We concluded the workshops with a multi-level hackathon, releasing customized Jupyter Notebooks tailored to different year groups:

- **1st & 2nd-year students**: Two levels üèÖ
- **3rd-year students**: Three levels üèÖ
- **4th-year students**: one levels üèÖ

These notebooks are designed to match each group's skill level, providing a structured path to deepen their quantum computing knowledge. 



## Giveaways
